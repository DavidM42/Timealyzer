# Timealyzer
## This project enables you to find out how much time you've spent in some locations

# Warning
The script only works on Linux for me since my location history is quite large (~250mb json file) which adds up to around 2gb of RAM usage when loaded in Python. On Windows even 64bit Python trows a memory error at me because of that but on linux it works.




# Inspiration
I exported my location history via google takeout and wanted to find out how many hour I've played billard since I started playing it a few months back.
